        <p>What I can do</p>
        <p>
          I’m a software developer who helps individuals and businesses bring their ideas to life on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I build modern web applications using technologies like React, TypeScript, and Node.js 
          — everything from interactive front-ends to full-stack solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked on production-ready apps in remote Agile teams and can handle the full development process: 
          from planning and design to launch and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in Madrid and open to remote work. 
          If you’re looking for a developer who can turn ideas into smooth, user-friendly web experiences, I’d love to chat.
